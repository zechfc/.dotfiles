First I had to open a VIM and then entered the below configurations. I first started to struggle because I wasnt hitting esc and was stuck in the vim insert editor. The other problem I had was I was struggling to rename the file, but once I got some help I was able to rename it and change it to a txt file on the desktop.

syntax on
set ruler
set autoindent
set number
set ignorecase
color elflord
